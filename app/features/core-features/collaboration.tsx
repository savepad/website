    <h3>Collaboration</h3><br></br>

    <p>Savepad is made for collaboration! By default you’ll start out with a personal account. We’d recommend you keep that private. Simply create one or more new teams for home or work, and invite your colleagues, friends, or family to collaborate on saves with you.</p><br></br>

<p>Team accounts have all the functionality of your personal accounts, except that you get more control on roles, permissions, and access.</p><br></br>

<p>Once you’ve got your team accounts set up, each account works just like your own. Teams can share workspaces, collections, and collaborate on saves. Workspace owners and admins can define roles for each user. Owners and admins can select which users have access to which spaces and/or collections.</p>
