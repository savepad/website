    <p>By default, your first account on Savepad is a personal one. Personal accounts on Savepad ensure that all spaces, collections, and saves are private by default, visible only to you. Any other accounts you create can be kept personal too, or shared with collaborators or with the public.</p><br></br>

    <p>If youâ€™d like to change this, you can invite collaborators to teams, and establish which collaborators have which levels of access to different accounts, spaces, and collections.</p><br></br>

    <p>We're also working on the ability to make workspaces and collections published to the web, so you can show off your saves to the world as a reference, or as a portfolio!</p><br></br>
