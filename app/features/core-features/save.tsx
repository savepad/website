    <p>Saves are the core of working with Savepad.</p><br></br>

    <p>Every new addition — a URL, an image, a video, an audio, a code snippet, a note, or any other file upload — counts as a save. These can be curated and organized within structured workspaces and collections.</p><br></br>
    
    <p>Automatically, depending on the format, Savepad will enrich these saves with metadata such as titles, descriptions, and previews, to make them easy to find. And you can further make it easier to search by adding context such as notes, tags, and other details.</p><br></br>
