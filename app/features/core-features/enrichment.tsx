    <h3>Auto-enrichments</h3><br></br>


    <p>Browse your saves without leaving Savepad. Whenever possible, Savepad enriches all saves with further metadata and context, making things easy to find.</p><br></br>

    <p>While we&apos;ll add as much context as possible, such as subtitles, titles, captions, etc., where relevant, you can also further enrich your saves with custom notes and tags to ensure you&apos;ll always find them.</p><br></br>

    <p>For certain formats like images and videos, we&apos;re also working on ways to have them indexed with complete context, so they can be found via a simple text search. More on that coming up, so stay tuned!</p><br></br>
