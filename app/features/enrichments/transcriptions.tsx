    <p>For most files like audio, video, and documents uploaded to Savepad, we try our best to extract as much context as possible to make sure you find what you&apos;re looking for. This could include things like subtitles, lyrics, articles, etc., It&apos;s very much experimental at this stage, but we&apos;re constantly improving how we approach this.</p><br></br>
