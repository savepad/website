    <h3>URLs & Links</h3><br></br>

    <p>Resources, references, landing pages, ideas, articles, bookmarks, whatever the reason, Savepad is made to make your saved links shine. Whether you&apos;re saving links for a project, or as a collaborative bookmark manager, all links get scraped to make sure they&apos;re easy to find with all the applicable metadata, content, and context. URLs also get rich in-app previews to make them easy to navigate without ever leaving Savepad.</p><br></br>

    <p>Some URLs are more than others. While all URLs added to Savepad will be enriched with the basics (thumbnails, titles, descriptions, etc.) some other URLs need a little more love to make sure you find what you&apos;re looking for in the future.</p><br></br>

    <p>Saving a song from Spotify? We&apos;ll try to bring along the artist name, album art, lyrics, and genre. Dropping a YouTube link to a video? Let&apos;s try and bring the subtitles, channel details, and description so that you have all the context.</p><br></br>

    <p>You get the idea.</p><br></br>
