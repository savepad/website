    <p>Savepad recognizes code when added to a space. To save code, simply create a new note and paste your snippets there. You can create code blocks by placing triple backticks before and after the code block, and for syntax formatting on common languages like .js and .graphql, ensure to define the language after the opening backticks. We recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks to make the formatting easier to read, similar to markdown formatting.</p><br></br>
